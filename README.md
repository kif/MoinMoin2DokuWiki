# MoinMoin2DokuWiki
Convert MoinMoin wiki files to DokuWiki files!

MoinMoin is not a bad wiki engine, it just did not manage to do its transition from Python2 to Python3 by the time Python2 was removed from my server.
MoinMoin has been replaced by DokuWiki which is a simple to deploy (PHP-based) wiki engine.
Moreover, DokuWiki is supported by PanDoc while MoinMoin not ... thus this converter.

This converter was built with the help of this web page:
